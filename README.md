It is going to be a filter

So first time it shows up if you aren't on a team it gives you an option to make a name and create one

once you have created a team, it shows team name and current players on top

you can scroll or search for specific players divs which will have a button with their pk that says add

if add it will go to an add view that will then add thatr player to the team and reload the page

There will also be an x next to each players name on the team selection that will send to a subtract view that will take that polayer off of the team

Pretty good, just figured out how to show all the players, now search functionality should be pretty simple

Okay we have adding working. 

Things to do now
- add x's to take players off team
- write function to check if a player is on a team, return that team, or None
- only show players that are not currently on teams
